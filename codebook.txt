   where "t" denotes time
         "Body" represents the acceleration of the subject, 
         "Gravity" represents the acceleration of the gravitational pull,
         "Acc" represents accelerometer readings
         "gyro" represents gyroscope 3-axial (-X -Y -Z directions) signals
         "Jerk" represents the signal body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived over time,
         "Mag" denotes magnitude of signal
         "f" denotes frequency domina signals from Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)



with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
